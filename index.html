    <h3 style="font-family:verdana;">Piano QWERTY</h3>
    <p style="font-family:courier; font-size:14px; text-align:justify;">Piano QWERTY is a virtual piano in which you can play 2 octaves using the keys form "Q" to "I".
       Those keys only plays whites notes, but if you want to play the black notes you need to press 
        the keys "2", "3", "5", "6" and "7". 
        To control the octave of your piano you have two keys. First, the key "P" 
        controls the high octave and the key "O" return to the normal octave. 
        (You canÂ´t play an octave below of your normal octave) 
        Also, there is going to be a circle which is going to point out if you are playing a note. 
        If the circle is green this indicate that the note is on, but if there is no circle
        this means that you are not playing anything. 
        Finally, in the upper left corner of the piano you can find a slider that controls the main volume.
